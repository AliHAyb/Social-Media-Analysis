# Social-Media-Analysis

In this project, I will provide several tools to collect data from social media platforms, in this case "Twitter".
Then I will go through multiple analysis and use various techniques to make statiscal studies on data collected.

The tools used in the notebook are:
-Networkx for graph analysis 
-NLTK for sentiment and text analysis
-Scikitlearn for clustering analysis 
among others in order to get general overview on social media network analysis,
and understand what hidden insights we can extract from social media platforms.
